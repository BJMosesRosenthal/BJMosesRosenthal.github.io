        <p class="intro"><br>
I am a rising third-year studying sociology and computer science at the University of Chicago. I find each field interesting on their own, but am especially drawn to their intersection. I am currently focused on studying climate change's social impacts and how computer science can be used to aid the world in addressing the climate crisis.

I love school very much and have been fortunate to take a litany of amazing classes. Neil Brenner's <a href="https://ccct.uchicago.edu/courses/cities-space-power-introduction-to-urban-social-science/">Cities, Space, Power</a> and Andrew Abbott's <a href="https://home.uchicago.edu/~aabbott/">Sociological Theory</a> were particularly inspiring sociology courses. In computer science, Aaron Potechin's <a href="http://www.potechin.org/aaronpotechin/">Theory of Algorithms</a> was extremely rewarding with excellent (but very challenging!) PSETs. Non-major classes that have greatly influenced me were Ben Callard's Introduction to Wittgenstein and Alan Kolata's The Khmer.

Growing up in Chicago's North Suburbs and attending university in Hyde Park have made me keen on exploring the world outside Chicago. This motivated me to begin studying Mandarin in October 2022. I was drawn to Mandarin because as a non-Indo-European language it opens pathways to think, feel, and experience in a fundementally different ways than English. </p><br>

<p>To pursue this goal I decided to study Mandarin in Taipei for 7 months starting in June 2023. I am currently spending the summer at a language school. Come September I will begin a one semester exchange program at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/">National Taiwan University</a>. I look forward to continuing my Mandarin studies once I return to UChicago in January 2024.
