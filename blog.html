				Sitting at gate M29 waiting for my flight to board. I am very nervous, but also feel so excited and ready to experience a new place. I don't think I've registered that I'll be away for 7 months. It just feels like going on a solo vacation right now. Once I settle in it will be very different. <br><br> I don't know what to expect, but it is already cool to hear Mandarin be spoken by people at the gate. It is more than I have consistenly heard in a very long time. I can pick up a little bit but nothing meaningful. Still very cool. Yes I am really excited. Sad to leave my family and scared to go to a new place to live for longer than I've ever been out of Chicago, but I'm ready. Going to post this now before I board. - BJ
