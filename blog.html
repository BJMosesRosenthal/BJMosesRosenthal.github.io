                          Arrived in Taipei about 5 hours ago! Flight was smooth. Sat next to a Vietnamese-American who told me he is taking his kids to Vietnam for the first time. Took Taipei's rail system (the MRT) from the airport to the main train station to catch the GaoTie to Hualien, the city on Taiwan's east coast where I'll begin my bike trip tomorrow. Arrived a few hours before my 8:40 train was scheduled so I thought, why not book an earlier ticket on the 7:30 express train. This was an excellent plan in theory, but unfortunately its execution was um not well executed. <br><br>I picked up a new ticket and some food about 7:10 before heading to platform 4B as marked on the ticket with time to burn. However, confused by the signage, I mistakenly exited the platform on a one-way staircase. Seeing the exit counter I realize my mistake and ask the attendant for directions (my first time using Mandarin outside of class which, although I stumbled over my words and only understood 'turn left', was really cool!). I renavigate the station to arrive back at 4B within a few minutes. <br><br> I begin eating my food and after 5 minutes a train arrives. Although this train is scheduled to leave at 7:24, not 7:30 like my ticket says, the flashing train schedule indicating the next train isn't until 7:35. I think "Lucky me, The train is early!" hop on and continuing blissfully eating my breakfast. As the train pulls out of the station, I look around at my fellow passengers who are all dressed business casual – odd attire for a trip to the coast. Additionally, I start noticing this train car bears little resemblance to photos I've seen of the GaoTie. A bit confused, I GoogleMaps the final destination, which turns out to not only not stop at Hualien, but take me to Taiwan's opposite side! <br><br> Oops. <br><br> Laughing at myself, I get off at the first stop, book the next train back to Taipei main station and thankfully make it in time for my original 8:40 train, which I sit writing this on. Auspicious beginnings. Jokes aside, I'm happy this happened. It was memorable, low stakes, and I got the first experience of practicing Mandarin with strangers which buoyed my confidence. The only other thing to add is that I'm excited to eat in a restaurant later and order food for the first time in Mandarin. That will be awesome. If you made it through this bloc of text, thanks for reading! - BJ

				Sitting at gate M29 waiting for my flight to board. I am very nervous, but also feel so excited and ready to experience a new place. I don't think I've registered that I'll be away for 7 months. It just feels like going on a solo vacation right now. Once I settle in it will be very different. <br><br> I don't know what to expect, but it is already cool to hear Mandarin be spoken by people at the gate. It is more than I have consistenly heard in a very long time. I can pick up a little bit but nothing meaningful. Still very cool. Yes I am really excited. Sad to leave my family and scared to go to a new place to live for longer than I've ever been out of Chicago, but I'm ready. Going to post this now before I board. - BJ
